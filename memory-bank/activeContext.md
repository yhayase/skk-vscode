## Current Work Focus

The current development focus is on implementing the **dictionary registration feature**. This feature allows users to add new word-reading pairs to their user dictionary when a conversion candidate is not found or when they want to add a new entry.

### Registration Feature Implementation

The registration feature is not implemented as a separate "mode" like the input modes, but rather as a combination of three elements:

1. **Registration Editor Tab**
   - A specialized editor tab with a specific format
   - Contains the reading and an empty field for the word
   - Format: `読み:{reading}\n単語:`

2. **Registration Trigger**
   - Triggered when:
     - In InlineHenkanMode, moving past the last candidate
     - In MenuHenkanMode, moving past the last candidate
     - In MidashigoMode, when no candidates are found

3. **Registration Command**
   - VSCode command to process the registration
   - Extracts reading and word from the editor
   - Adds the entry to the user dictionary
   - Closes the registration editor
   - Returns focus to the original editor
   - Inserts the registered word at the cursor position

## Recent Changes

1. **Registration Editor Opening**
   - Implemented opening the registration editor from InlineHenkanMode
   - Implemented opening the registration editor from MenuHenkanMode
   - Implemented opening the registration editor from MidashigoMode

2. **Registration Content Handling**
   - Implemented proper formatting of the registration editor content
   - Added support for converting katakana readings to hiragana in the editor

3. **Registration Command**
   - Implemented the registration command to add entries to the user dictionary
   - Added logic to close the registration editor after registration
   - Implemented focus return to the original editor
   - Added word insertion at the cursor position after registration

4. **Testing**
   - Added integration tests for the registration feature
   - Implemented tests for different registration scenarios
   - Added tests for okurigana handling in registration

## Next Steps

1. **Registration Mode Implementation**
   - Implement a dedicated mode for the registration editor
   - Add specialized key handling for the registration mode

2. **Registration Command Enhancement**
   - Add support for executing the registration command with a keyboard shortcut
   - Improve error handling for invalid registration inputs

3. **Refactoring**
   - Refactor duplicate code in registration editor opening logic
   - Improve the architecture of the registration feature

4. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to include the registration feature
   - Add usage examples for the registration workflow

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Registration Editor Format**
   - Using a simple text format for the registration editor
   - Considering whether to add more structure or validation

2. **Registration Workflow**
   - Current workflow follows SKK conventions
   - Evaluating if any VSCode-specific improvements could be made

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Monitoring the performance impact of dictionary updates
   - Ensuring smooth user experience during registration

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Using integration tests to verify the complete registration workflow
   - Considering additional unit tests for specific components

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Command-Based Interaction**
   - Using VSCode commands for user interactions
   - Following the established pattern of `skk.<action>` for command naming

2. **Editor Abstraction**
   - Continuing to use the editor abstraction for all text manipulations
   - Ensuring registration features work through the abstraction layer

3. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Implementing tests alongside or before feature implementation
   - Using tests to verify correct behavior across different scenarios

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **VSCode Editor Limitations**
   - Working around limitations in VSCode's editor API
   - Finding creative solutions for SKK-style interactions

2. **State Management Complexity**
   - Managing the complex state transitions between modes
   - Ensuring proper cleanup and initialization during transitions

3. **Testing Challenges**
   - Addressing challenges in testing asynchronous editor operations
   - Developing reliable test patterns for VSCode extension features
