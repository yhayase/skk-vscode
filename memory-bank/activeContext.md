# Active Context: skk-vscode

## Current Work Focus

The current development focus is on:
- Implementing the **candidate deletion feature**
- Completing the **dictionary registration feature**
- **Keybinding contextualization and optimization (Issue #55) - Basic Implementation Complete**: The foundational work for fine-grained keybinding control using VSCode's `when` clause contexts is complete. This includes updates to core SKK logic, context update mechanisms in the VSCode layer, and `package.json` modifications. Remaining work involves full coverage for all modes and comprehensive testing.

The candidate deletion feature allows users to delete unwanted candidates from their dictionary during conversion. This is useful for removing incorrect or outdated entries.

The dictionary registration feature allows users to add new word-reading pairs to their user dictionary when a conversion candidate is not found or when they want to add a new entry.

### Registration Feature Implementation

The registration feature is not implemented as a separate "mode" like the input modes, but rather as a combination of three elements:

1. **Registration Editor Tab**
   - A specialized editor tab with a specific format
   - Contains the reading and an empty field for the word
   - Format: `読み:{reading}\n単語:`

2. **Registration Trigger**
   - Triggered when:
     - In InlineHenkanMode, moving past the last candidate
     - In MenuHenkanMode, moving past the last candidate
     - In MidashigoMode, when no candidates are found

3. **Registration Command**
   - VSCode command to process the registration
   - Extracts reading and word from the editor
   - Adds the entry to the user dictionary
   - Closes the registration editor
   - Returns focus to the original editor
   - Inserts the registered word at the cursor position

## Recent Changes

1. **Candidate Deletion Implementation**
   - Implemented CandidateDeletionMode for handling candidate deletion
   - Added confirmation dialog for deletion (Y/N prompt)
   - Implemented dictionary entry removal functionality
   - Added support for deletion in different input contexts (hiragana, katakana, okurigana)

2. **Registration Editor Opening**
   - Implemented opening the registration editor from InlineHenkanMode
   - Implemented opening the registration editor from MenuHenkanMode
   - Implemented opening the registration editor from MidashigoMode

3. **Registration Content Handling**
   - Implemented proper formatting of the registration editor content
   - Added support for converting katakana readings to hiragana in the editor

4. **Registration Command**
   - Implemented the registration command to add entries to the user dictionary
   - Added logic to close the registration editor after registration
   - Implemented focus return to the original editor
   - Added word insertion at the cursor position after registration

5. **Testing**
   - Added integration tests for the candidate deletion feature
   - Added integration tests for the registration feature
   - Implemented tests for different registration scenarios
   - Added tests for okurigana handling in registration and deletion

## Next Steps

**Issue #55: Keybinding Contextualization - Remaining Tasks**
-   **Complete Mode Implementation**: Ensure `getActiveKeys()` and `getContextualName()` are fully implemented for all remaining input mode classes (especially `InlineHenkanMode`, `MenuHenkanMode`, `AbbrevMode`, `CandidateDeletionMode` and any other `AbstractHenkanMode` subclasses). Add comprehensive unit tests for these.
-   **Targeted Integration Tests**: Create new integration tests specifically designed to verify:
    -   Correctness of `skk.mode` and `skk.activeKey.*` context values across various mode transitions and states.
    -   That keybindings are correctly enabled/disabled based on these contexts, ensuring SKK only captures keys when appropriate.
-   **Manual Testing & Debugging**: Conduct thorough manual testing across all SKK features to identify and fix any regressions or unexpected keybinding behavior.
-   **Performance Review**: Assess if the context update mechanism introduces any noticeable performance overhead, especially during rapid mode changes or typing. Optimize if necessary.
-   **Documentation**: Update any relevant developer or user documentation regarding keybinding behavior if changes are significant.

**Existing Next Steps**
1. **Candidate Deletion Enhancement**
   - Add keyboard shortcut documentation for the deletion feature
   - Consider adding a menu-based deletion option for multiple candidates
   - Improve error handling for deletion operations

2. **Registration Mode Implementation**
   - Implement a dedicated mode for the registration editor
   - Add specialized key handling for the registration mode

3. **Registration Command Enhancement**
   - Add support for executing the registration command with a keyboard shortcut
   - Improve error handling for invalid registration inputs

4. **Refactoring**
   - Refactor duplicate code in registration editor opening logic
   - Improve the architecture of the registration feature

5. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to include both the registration and deletion features
   - Add usage examples for both workflows

## Active Decisions and Considerations

**Issue #55: Keybinding Contextualization - Key Decisions Made**
-   **Context Design Implemented**:
    -   `skk.mode`: Uses `IInputMode.getContextualName()` (e.g., `"ascii"`, `"hiragana:kakutei"`, `"midashigo"`).
    -   `skk.activeKey.[SAFE_KEY_NAME]`: Uses `IInputMode.getActiveKeys()` and `keyUtils.getActiveKeyContext()` to generate safe context keys (e.g., `skk.activeKey.a`, `skk.activeKey.ctrl_j`, `skk.activeKey.num0`).
-   **Key Name Normalization**: `keyUtils.ts` provides `normalizeVscodeKey` (for `package.json` `key` property to internal representation) and `getActiveKeyContext` (for internal representation to context key suffix).
-   **Context Update Mechanism**: `VSCodeEditor` handles context updates via `updateSkkContexts()`, triggered by `setInputMode()` and `notifyModeInternalStateChanged()`.

**Issue #55: Keybinding Contextualization - Ongoing Considerations**
-   **Performance**: Continue to monitor the impact of `setContext` calls, especially with many active keys or rapid changes. The optimization to update contexts only when values change has been implemented in `VSCodeEditor.updateSkkContexts`.
-   **Coverage & Robustness**: Ensuring all modes and edge cases are correctly handled by `getActiveKeys` and `getContextualName` is critical. The list of active keys for some modes (e.g., those that throw errors for many inputs) needs to be comprehensive.
-   **Clarity of `skk.mode` values**: The composite names like `"hiragana:kakutei"` are informative but need to be consistently applied and documented.

1. **Candidate Deletion Workflow**
   - Using 'X' key during conversion to trigger deletion mode
   - Requiring explicit confirmation (Y/N) to prevent accidental deletions
   - Considering whether to add an undo feature for deletions

2. **Registration Editor Format**
   - Using a simple text format for the registration editor
   - Considering whether to add more structure or validation

3. **Registration Workflow**
   - Current workflow follows SKK conventions
   - Evaluating if any VSCode-specific improvements could be made

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Monitoring the performance impact of dictionary updates
   - Ensuring smooth user experience during registration and deletion

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Using integration tests to verify the complete workflows
   - Considering additional unit tests for specific components

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Command-Based Interaction**
   - Using VSCode commands for user interactions
   - Following the established pattern of `skk.<action>` for command naming

2. **Editor Abstraction**
   - Continuing to use the editor abstraction for all text manipulations
   - Ensuring registration and deletion features work through the abstraction layer

3. **Mode-Based State Machine**
   - Adding new modes (like CandidateDeletionMode) to handle specific interactions
   - Maintaining clear transitions between modes

4. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Implementing tests alongside or before feature implementation
   - Using tests to verify correct behavior across different scenarios
